## Cats
First of all, I will have to tell you about one of my passion: cats.
I love them, they are so cute and incredible. If you have one you should understand. Mine is called "Zadig". He's a black cat but he's cute. He's the most incredible cat on earth, I'm sure. 
Do you know why they are so incredible? Because they are lazy :zzz:. Just like me. Me? Oh yeah, that's right, I have to introduce myself.

## Me
I'm Simon, a French student at ISEN lille. I have been interested in computers for 2 years (the same year I started my school). I started with python, because *ehm*, I don't know, it's a language I still enjoy, even if some languages are starting to take its place in my heart. 1 year ago i started Haskell (and now APL <3) and I really enjoyed it. For my studies, we are learning C, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

Writing code doesn't really interest me for the moment, I prefer to try to take a step back on programming languages, types system and the mathematical foundations of programming.

But I can take you to one of my current projects : [Paso](https://github.com/SimonHauguel/Paso)
