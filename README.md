## Cats
:smiley_cat: First of all, I will have to tell you about one of my passion: cats.
I love them :heart_eyes_cat:, they are so cute and incredible. If you have one you should understand. Mine is called "Zadig". He's a black cat but he's cute. He's the most incredible cat on earth, I'm sure. 
Do you know why they are so incredible? Because they are lazy :zzz:. Just like me. Me? Oh yeah, that's right, I have to introduce myself.

## Me
I'm Simon, a French student at ISEN lille. Currently in my first year, this github account is the one of my studies. Everything that I undertake in connection with my courses will be put here. 
I am a beginner, at least I consider myself a beginner :crying_cat_face:. But I know my preferences. I love (but bad in practice :crying_cat_face:) functional languages. Like Haskell. I also know how to have fun with Python (especially making dark and terrifying lambda calculus tests with it). 
I don't have a major project to present to you, I'm just starting. But I hope there will be some in the future. :pray: 
Especially since I'll be able to have fun with other languages. That I will learn (in part) during my studies.

## Tooling
Otherwise, I use Manjaro as OS (my beard is growing a bit). With I3 (my beard is growing a bit more). And emacs for...everything else. (my beard is now quite long).  So I might spend more time configuring some extensions than programming.

# TL;DR
In short, if I had to summarize, I'm a passionate student, with a big margin of progression and who does everything to improve!
